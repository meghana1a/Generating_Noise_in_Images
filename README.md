# Generating_Noise_in_Images
Read an image matrix and randomly flip the matrix entries (5%, 15%, 25%, 30%) of the total elements and apply R3, R5, R7, and R9 in each case.

Inference:
The generated photos show that when the order of repetition code grows, channel noise is overcome with more precision and accuracy, resulting in an image that is virtually identical to the originally transmitted image but with more parity information. The coding rate can be automatically altered to accommodate different channel capacity, however the order of repeat code must be determined with the bandwidth cost in mind.
Images delivered via a noisy channel are incorrectly received. The repeat code order is determined by the degree of mistake at the receiver's end.
